	    <p>This is a python script I made for <a href = "www.appboy.com"> Appboy</a> that pulls information from Crunch Base using their API  and scrapes it to find companies of a specific type (in this case its mobile app startups). From there it goes back into the API to find more information on the company, like their phone number, email address, and company type. The information is then converted into a CSV file located in the data folder. The file's name depends on the search terms and the time the code was executed</p>

	    <p><strong>	APIs Used:</strong> CrunchBase API </p>
