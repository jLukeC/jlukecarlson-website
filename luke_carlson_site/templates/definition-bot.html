	    <h2 class = "centered">Twitter Definition Bot</h2>
	    <p>The purpose of this project was to make a twitter account to which anyone could tweet at and it would respond with the definition of the tweeted word</p>
	    <br/>
	    <h3 class="centered"><em>How?</em></h3>
	    <br/>
	    <p> First we checked twitter's JSON feed of recent tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/definitionbot">@DefinitionBot</a> (the feed can be seen <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=@DefinitionBot"> here</a>) and parsed out new tweets. </p>
	    <p>From there we extracted the word and put it through Abbreviations.com's API to get a definition. We chose Abbr's API because it provided its definitions in a consise format, which is important considering that Tweets are maxed out at 140 characters.</p>
	    <p>After that we parsed the XML response to get the definition of the word. From there we concatenated the definition along with the word into a tweet that was directed back at the original user.</p>
	    <p>Isues and Bugs we faced included a problem where <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/definitionbot">@DefinitionBot</a> would tweet back two definitions at a user, issues that arose when the tweet was too long, and determining whether tweets from twitter's stream were new or just repeated</p>
	    <p><strong>	Programming Language:</strong> Python</p>
	    <p><strong>	APIs Used:</strong> Twitter API, Abbreviations.com API </p>
	    <p><strong>	A few Modules used:</strong> JSON, simpleJSON, BeautifulSoup, urllib2, tweepy </p>
